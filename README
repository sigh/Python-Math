Some python math functions. Most of these were created while I was working through Project Euler.

primes.py contains an infinite prime list
    Can do everything you would expect from an infinite list:
    - retieve primes by index
    - slice the list
    - iterate over the list
    - test if the list contains a given value

factors.py does factoriation and can calculate other properties related to the factorisation of a number

combin.py can count and generate subsets, combinations and permutations

ntheory.py has some miscellaneous number theory functions
